\section*{Abstract}

\textit{Xarray} is an open source project and Python package that provides data structures for N-dimensional labeled arrays inspired by pandas.
It provides a \textit{pandas}-like and \textit{pandas}-compatible toolkit for analytics on multi-dimensional arrays, rather than the tabular data format for which \textit{pandas} excels.
Our approach adopts the Common Data Model for self-describing scientific data that is widely used in the geo-science community.
Xarray builds on top of and seamlessly interoperates with the core scientific Python packages, such as \textit{NumPy}, \textit{SciPy}, \textit{matplotlib}, and \textit{pandas}.

\section*{(1) Overview}

\section*{Introduction}

% SH: tightened up description of numpy/scipy/pandas, moved description of the
% pandas Index to later.

Python has emerged as a leading programing language for both the physical sciences and data science.
At the core of modern scientific computing and analysis in Python are the \textit{NumPy} and \textit{SciPy} packages \citep{Jones_2001,van_der_Walt_2011}, which provide a robust N-dimensional array object and the fundamental operations built upon required for science and engineering applications.
However, much of the success of Python in data science and business analytics is
due to \textit{Pandas} \citep{mckinney_2010}, which introduced intuitive and fast tabular data analysis tools to Python inspired by R's data.frame [CITE].
The pandas \textit{DataFrame} and \textit{Series} objects provide unparalleled analysis tools for data alignment, resampling, grouping, pivoting, and aggregation.

% SH: I removed significant duplication in this next paragraph with the abstract

Xarray implements data structures and an analytics toolkit for multi-dimensional
labeled arrays strongly inspired by pandas.
Pandas does include a data structure for three dimensional data, the \textit{Panel}, but the fixed rank design of pandas's data structures makes them unsuitable for applications that require arbitrary rank arrays.
Our approach with xarray adopts the self-describing Common Data Model on which the Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) is built on \citep{Rew_1990,Brown_1993}, which provides a well defined data model for labeled N-dimensional array-oriented scientific data analysis.

\textit{Xarray} builds on top of, and seamlessly interoperates with the core scientific Python packages, such as \textit{NumPy}, \textit{SciPy}, \textit{matplotlib} \citep{Hunter_2007}, and \textit{pandas}.
\textit{Xarray} provides a range of backends for serialization and IO, including the pickle, NetCDF, OPeNDAP, GRIB, and HDF file formats.
Leveraging the \textit{dask} parallel computing library, \textit{xarray} can optionally perform efficient parallel, out-of-core analysis on datasets that are too large to fit into memory.
Finally, \textit{xarray} interfaces with existing, domain specific packages such as \textit{UV-CDAT} \citep{uvcdat}, \textit{Iris} \citep{Iris}, and \textit{Cartopy} \citep{Cartopy}.

% SH: I'm not sure how much value this figure provides. I think the text covers
% this pretty clearly and the pixelated nature of this particular dataset
% makes for an ugly figure.

	\caption{An example of a multidimensional labeled array. This figure (map) is showing the surface air temperature for the region encompassing North America for a particular day (January 1, 2013). The map is labeled with the array's coordinates, longitude and latitude.}
	\label{fig:temperature_map}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Purpose: Your data has labels, you should use them}

Scientific data is inherently labeled.
For example, time series data includes timestamps that label individual points in time, spatial data has coordinates (e.g. longitude, latitude, elevation), and model or laboratory experiments are often identified by unique identifiers.
Figure \ref{fig:temperature_map} provides an example of a labeled dataset, in this case the data is a map of air temperature over North-America from a numeric weather model.
The labels on this particular dataset are time (e.g. ``2013-01-01''), longitude (x-axis), and latitude (y-axis).

Raw N-dimensional arrays of numbers, implemented in the SciPy ecosystem by \text{NumPy}, are the most widely used data structure in scientific computing.
However, they lack a meaningful representation of the metadata associated with their data.
Implementing such functionality is left to individual users and domain specific packages.

So, is the time axis of my array in the first or third index position?
Or, does my array of timestamps still align with my data after resampling?
These sorts of operations and questions are frequent pitfalls of data scientists.
Our core motivation to developing \textit{xarray} is provide labeled data tools
for N-dimensional arrays that render such questions moot, because the tools
themselves use and preserve the consistency of labels and data.

\textbf{NetCDF}

The Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) is a collection of self-describing, machine-independent binary data formats and software tools.
These data formats and tools facilitate the creation, access, and sharing of scientific data stored in N-dimensional arrays, alongside metadata describing the contents of each array \citep{Rew_1990}.
NetCDF has become very popular in the geoscience community, and there are existing libraries for reading and writing netCDF in many programming languages, including C, Fortran, Python, Java, Matlab, and Julia.

The principle data structure in the NetCDF data model is the \textit{dataset}.
Each NetCDF \textit{dataset} contains \textit{dimensions}, \textit{variables}, and \textit{attributes}, each of which are identified by unique names.
The \textit{dataset} and \textit{variable} objects may contain \textit{attributes} that describe the contents, units, history, or other metadata of the object.
Standardized conventions, such as the Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions \citep{eaton2003netcdf} allow for the associations of coordinate variables with \textit{dimensions}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{dataset-diagram_original}
	\caption{An example of how a dataset (NetCDF or xarray) for a weather forecast might be structured.  This dataset has three dimensions: time, y, and x.  \textit{Temperature} and \textit{precipitation} are three-dimensional arrays that have dimensions time, y, and x.  Also included in the dataset are two-dimensional coordinate arrays \textit{latitude} and \textit{longitude}, having dimensions y and x, and \textit{reference time}, a zero-dimensional (scalar) array.}
	\label{fig:dataset_diagram}
\end{figure}

\section*{Implementation and architecture}

NetCDF forms the basis of the \textit{xarray} data model, providing a natural and portable serialization format.
\textit{Xarray} provides three main data structures, the \textit{Dataset}, the \textit{DataArray}, and the \textit{Coordinate} (see figure \ref{fig:dataset_diagram}).

\textbf{DataArray}

The \textit{DataArray} is \textit{xarray}'s implementation of a labeled, multi-dimensional array. It has several key properties:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{data}: N-dimensional array (\textit{NumPy} or \textit{dask}) holding the arrayâ€™s values
	\item \textit{dims}: dimension names for each axis (e.g., \verb|('time', 'latitude', 'longitude')|)
	\item \textit{coords}: dict-like container of arrays (coordinates) that label each point (e.g., 1-dimensional arrays of numbers, \textit{datetime} objects or strings)
	\item \textit{attrs}: \textit{OrderedDict} holding arbitrary metadata (e.g. units or descriptions)
\end{itemize}

\textit{Xarray} uses \textit{dims} and \textit{coords} to enable its core metadata aware operations.
Dimensions provide names that \textit{xarray} uses instead of the axis argument found in many \textit{NumPy} functions.
Coordinates enable fast label based indexing and alignment, building on the functionality of the pandas \textit{Index}.
\textit{DataArray} objects also can have a name and can hold arbitrary metadata in the form of their \textit{attrs} property, which can be used to further describe data (e.g. by providing units).
Names and attributes are strictly for users and user-written code; in general \textit{xarray} makes no attempt to interpret them, and propagates them only in unambiguous cases.

\textbf{Coordinate}

Coordinates are ancillary variables stored for \textit{DataArray} and \textit{Dataset} objects in the \textit{coords} attribute.
Unlike attributes, \textit{xarray} does interpret and persist coordinates in operations that transform \textit{xarray} objects.
One dimensional coordinates with a name equal to their sole dimension take on a special meaning in \textit{xarray}.
They are used for label based indexing and alignment, like the \textit{Index} found on a \textit{pandas} objects.
Their implementation also makes use of the pandas Index, an immutable ordered set backed by a hash-table.

\textbf{Dataset}

The \textit{Dataset} is \textit{xarray}â€™s multi-dimensional equivalent of a \textit{DataFrame}. It is a dict-like container of labeled arrays (\textit{DataArray}s) with aligned dimensions.
It is designed as an in-memory representation of a NetCDF dataset.
In addition to the dict-like interface of the dataset itself, which can be used to access any \textit{DataArray} in a \textit{Dataset}, datasets have four key properties:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{dims}: dictionary mapping from dimension names to the fixed length of each dimension (e.g., \verb|{'x': 6, 'y': 6, 'time': 8}|)
	\item \textit{data vars}: dict-like container of \textit{DataArray}s corresponding to variables
	\item \textit{coords}: dict-like container of \textit{DataArray}s intended to label points used in \textit{data vars} (e.g., 1-dimensional arrays of numbers, \textit{datetime} objects or strings)
	\item \textit{attrs}: \textit{OrderedDict} to hold arbitrary metadata pertaining to the dataset
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Core Xarray Features}

\textit{Xarray} includes a robust feature set.
The following list highlights some of the key features available in \textit{xarray}.
The \textit{xarray} documentation \citep{xarray_docs} includes a complete description of the available features, their usage, as well as detailed examples.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Label-based indexing}: Similarly to \textit{pandas} objects, \textit{xarray} objects support both integer and label based lookups along each dimension.
	However, \textit{xarray} objects also have named dimensions, so you can optionally use dimension names instead of relying on the positional ordering of dimensions.
	\item \textit{Arithmetic}: arithmetic on \textit{xarray} objects is vectorized using the underlying N-dimensional array.
	\item \textit{Split-apply-combine}: \textit{xarray} includes N-dimensional grouped operations implementing the split-apply-combine strategy \ref{Wickham_2011}.
	\item \textit{Resampling and Rolling Window}: utilizing the efficient resampling methods from \textit{pandas} and rolling window operations from \textit{bottleneck}, \textit{xarray} offers a robust set of resampling and rolling window operations along a single dimension.
	\item \textit{Plotting}: \textit{xarray} plotting functionality is a thin wrapper around the popular \textit{matplotlib} library. \textit{Matplotlib} syntax and function names were copied as much as possible, which makes for an easy transition between the two.
	\item \textit{Interactivity with pandas}: One of the most important features of \textit{xarray} is the ability to convert to and from \textit{pandas} objects to interact with the rest of the PyData ecosystem.
	\item \textit{Serialization and I/O}: \textit{xarray} supports direct serialization and IO to several file formats including pickle, NetCDF, OPeNDAP, GRIB, and HDF by integrating with third-party libraries. Additional serialization formats for 1-dimensional data are available through \textit{pandas}.
	% SH: add dask explicitly? Maybe not?
\end{itemize}

\section*{Quality control}

% If not already included in the software documentation, provide details of how a user could quickly understand if the software is working (e.g. providing examples of running the software with sample input and output data). }

\textit{Xarray} is provided with a large test suite comprised of over 900 unit tests.
These tests cover the core \textit{xarray} functionality as well as features facilitated by optional dependencies.
The unit tests are executed automatically on the TravisCI (Linux) \citep{TravisCI} and Appveyor (Windows) \citep{Appveyor} continuous integration systems.
A selection of sample data is also distributed with the source code, allowing users to reproduce any examples in the \textit{xarray} documentation.

\section*{(3) Reuse potential}

\textit{Xarray} was written in a modular, objected-oriented way, to build upon and extend the core scientific Python libraries in a domain agnostic fashion.
We have intentionally avoided including domain specific functionality in the library, leaving that to third party libraries.
It has been widely adopted in the geoscience community \citep[e.g.][]{Dawson_2016a,Dawson_2016b,xgcm}, but has also been used in physics \citep[e.g.][]{pycalphad}, general time series analytics [cite cesium.ml] and finance.
\textit{Xarray} is developed and supported by a team of volunteers. The primary avenue for user support is \textit{StackOverflow} \citep{stackoverflow}, with the ``xarray-python'' tag.
Additionally, we use GitHub for a bug tracker (\url{https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues}) and maintain the ``xarray'' mailing list on Google groups (\url{https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/xarray}).
